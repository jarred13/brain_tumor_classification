Detecting Brain Tumors in MRIs using a Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning

This project uses a dataset found on Kaggle. The purpose of this project was to take images of brain MRIs and apply a convolutional neural network to be able to accurately predict if there is a tumor in the image. The file attached is a jupyter notebook where you will find the code and results.
